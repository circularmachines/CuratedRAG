  
As of my last training data in September 2021, Obsidian is a popular note-taking and knowledge management application that utilizes markdown for note creation and editing. It is renowned for its unique approach to note-taking, which emphasizes linking between notes to create a personal knowledge graph. Users create notes, which can then be interlinked through wiki-style links, allowing the formation of a network of information. Obsidian allows users to navigate through their notes by following links, exploring backlinks, and visualizing the connections between notes through a graph view.

The application supports a variety of plugins and extensions to enhance functionality, which includes Kanban boards, calendars, and various editors. Obsidian is versatile in its use-cases and is utilized by individuals for purposes such as Zettelkasten-style note-taking, project management, and personal wikis. It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux and offers a mobile app for both iOS and Android.

Obsidianâ€™s primary focus on creating and exploring the relationships between notes makes it stand out among other note-taking apps, providing users with a powerful tool to manage and interconnect their knowledge in a meaningful way. The platform also respects user privacy, as all data is stored locally on the user's device, although users can opt to sync data across devices using Obsidian Sync, a paid service.

Always check the most recent updates from the official Obsidian website or platform since the software is consistently updated, and new features or changes may have been introduced after my last training date.
