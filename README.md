Curated RAG is a simple [prototype](/vault/prototype.md) that showcases how to use [Obsidian](/vault/Obsidian.md) to create [LLM](/vault/LLM.md) driven [chatbot](/vault/chatbot.md) instances. The plan is to make an [open source](/vault/open%20source.md) [project](/vault/project.md) out of it.

The idea is based on an [Iterative process](/vault/Iterative%20process.md).

There is a [python app](/vault/python%20app.md) running in the background accessing the md files in the [vault](/vault/vault.md).
