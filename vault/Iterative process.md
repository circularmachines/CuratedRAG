The suggested iterative way of working:

1. Add relevant [[queries]] that you want your [[chatbot]] to be able to [[respond]] to
2. Add [[knowledge]] needed to [[respond]] to [[queries]]
3. Evaluate [[chatbot]] performance
4. Update [[notes]] in [[vault]] to help [[chatbot]] [[access]] the correct [[knowledge]]
