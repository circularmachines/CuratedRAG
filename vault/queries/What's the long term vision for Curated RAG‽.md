#### [[index]]
Curated RAG is a simple [[prototype]] that showcases how to use [[Obsidian]] to create [[LLM]] driven [[chatbot]] instances. The plan is to make an [[open source]] [[project]] out of it

The idea is based on an [[Iterative process]]

Check out [[Quick Start]] for information of how to use it

There is a [[python app]] running in the background accessing the md files in the [[vault]]


#### [[Iterative process]]

The suggested iterative way of working:

1. Add relevant [[queries]] that you want your [[chatbot]] to be able to [[respond]] to
2. Add [[knowledge]] needed to [[respond]] to [[queries]]
3. Evaluate [[chatbot]] performance
4. Update [[notes]] in [[vault]] to help [[chatbot]] [[access]] the correct [[knowledge]]
#### [[open source]]
I love open source for reasons I will come back to #todo
#### [[project]]
It's not a real project yet, but when it is, the documentation and project planning will be inside this [[obsidian]] [[vault]]. It's all very [[meta]]

Check out the [[roadmap]] that hopefully leads to the [[vision]]

Amazing humans, and their AI derivatives, collaborating to save the world
## Answer
The long term vision for Curated RAG is to create an open source project that uses an iterative process of adding relevant queries, adding knowledge to respond to these queries, evaluating the chatbot's performance, and updating notes in the vault to help the chatbot access the correct knowledge. The ultimate vision is to have humans and their AI derivatives collaborating to save the world.
