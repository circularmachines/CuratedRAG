Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a model architecture that combines pre-trained language models with information retrieval systems to facilitate the generation of more knowledgeable and informative responses in a dialogue system or text generator. RAG, which was introduced by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in a paper published in 2020, extends the capabilities of standard sequence-to-sequence models by enabling them to retrieve and utilize information from an external knowledge source (a corpus of text) during the generation process.

The RAG model operates in two main steps:

### 1. **Retrieval Step:**

- When given an input (such as a question or a prompt), the model sends a query to a document store or database to retrieve relevant documents or passages.
- The retrieval is performed using a pre-trained retriever model (often based on a dense vector search) that aims to find the most relevant information in the corpus to the given query.

### 2. **Generation Step:**

- The retrieved documents or passages are then provided to a sequence-to-sequence model alongside the original input.
- The generator model, which is also pre-trained, generates a response that incorporates information from the retrieved documents.

This two-step process enables the model to produce responses that utilize specific information and knowledge contained in the external corpus, which it wouldnâ€™t have access to otherwise. This approach is particularly useful for question answering and knowledge-intensive tasks where having access to a broader knowledge base can significantly improve the quality and informativeness of the generated responses.

RAG effectively combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models, potentially providing more accurate and informative responses in a variety of natural language processing applications, such as conversational agents, question answering systems, and more.
